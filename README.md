[[Project Page]()] [[Paper Link]()] [[Dataset]()]

This is the codebase for our paper TimeLens-XL, which has been accepted by ECCV2024. In this paper, we propose a lightweight netowrk for Event-VFI which is able to interpoalte for large motions in realtime at 720p resolution. We provide pretrained weights, code for evaluation for both our TLXNet, TLXNet+, and state-of-the-art methods.
